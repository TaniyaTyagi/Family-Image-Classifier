#  Family Image Classifier

This project is a **Family Member Image Classification App** built using **Machine Learning** and **Streamlit**.  
The model predicts which family member is present in the uploaded image.

##  Project Overview

The model is trained on a dataset of family member images and classifies an uploaded image into one of the following categories:

| Label | Person Name  |
|------|--------------|
| 0    | Chote papa   |
| 1    | Lakshay      |
| 2    | Mummy        |
| 3    | Pita ji      |
| 4    | Taniya       |

The model file: `family_model.pkl`  
The app interface is built using: `Streamlit`


##  **How to Run the Project**

### 1️ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TaniyaTyagi/Family-Image-Classifier.git
cd model-6
```
### 2. Install Required Libraries

Make sure Python is installed, then run:

pip install streamlit numpy pillow

### 3. Place Model File

Ensure the family_model.pkl is located in the same directory as myfile.py.

### 4. Run the Streamlit App
streamlit run myfile.py


### -> File Structure
project/
```
│-- family_model.pkl
│-- myfile.py
│-- README.md
```


## User Interface Flow:
  * Upload a family member image (.jpg, .jpeg, .png)
  * The model processes the image
  * The predicted name is displayed


## Example Output
```
Predicted Member Name: Mummy
```

## Future Enhancements
  * Improve model accuracy using a larger dataset
  * Add face detection for better cropping
  *  Deploy app online using Streamlit Cloud / Heroku
